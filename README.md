# Music-Search-with-Django

Django music search is a music search application that utilizes the Django web framework. Django is a powerful web framework for Python, known for its ease of use and rapid development capabilities. This Django project has a search form for music that integrates the iTunes API. When a user submits the form, the app calls the API with the search term and displays the results on a new page.

Here, I used django-admin start project music to create a new project. I then created a new app called search. The project has 2 HTML pages. The first page is a HTML form used to get the user's input to search the song. The app calls the iTunes API using the input given by the user and then the second HTML page displays the result.
